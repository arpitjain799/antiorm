   TODO: antiorm
===================

- Check that dbapiext properly avoids creating a new stmt every time
  (sends a constant stmt for a constant req).

  - Cache the stmt making engine depending the types provided at
    input, including list lengths.

- dbapiext.py: Add examples on the web page that describes how to
  clean up code.



antipool:

- Explain in more detail what happens if the DB server gets restarted and while
  some connections had been allocated.  Are they cleared properly?

  See DBUtils:

    DBUtils.SolidDB is a module implementing "hardened" connections to a database,
    based on ordinary connections made by any DB-API 2 database module. A
    "hardened" connection will transparently reopen upon access when it has been
    closed or the database connection has been lost or when it is used more often
    than an optional usage limit.

    A typical example where this is needed is when the database has been restarted
    while your application is still running and has open connections to the
    database, or when your application accesses a remote database in a network
    that is separated by a firewall and the firewall has been restarted and lost
    its state.

- Prevent DELETE without a WHERE

- Add to script debug_unreleased option

- Test user_readonly option

- Add support for Python-2.5's with statement

- Make sure autocommit is disabled on antipool startup.

- Output gnuplot graphs of acquired vs. pool size in debugging mode.

- Write a better test for speed.
